# Overall Rules

* Follow the format as much as possible
* If you want to introduce a new category create an issue or discussion first
* When removing links, migrate them the [obsolete.md](obsolete.md) page in a pull request
* One addition per pull request unless it's unreasonable to do so
* You're welcome to suggest changes anywhere using PRs, however they are seen as suggestions and not commitments

# Apps
* Include the vendors website as the link on the name, then include locations you can get it afterwards
* Verify the links
* Ensure that the application runs

# Communities
* Communities must either be large, or have sustained activity over a long period of time

# Youtube
* Rules will adapt over time, current strong preference for older content and content relating to academic material
