# awesome-fodmap-resources

Like all [Awesome Lists](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome) this is intended to be a filtered (eventually) list of content relating to FODMAP which any one can contribute to like a wiki. A guide can be found here: https://github.com/component-driven/awesome-list/blob/master/Contributing.md Please use, share, and if you can contribute.

This is just a list at the moment, I will work on the 'awesome' component of it (ie set restrictions and filters) when there are more resources here.
